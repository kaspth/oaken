# Oaken

Oaken is an alternative to fixtures and/or factories to manage your development, test and some production data using data scripts.

## Setup

### Starting in development

You can set it up in `db/seeds.rb`, like this:

```ruby
Oaken.prepare do
  seed :accounts, :data
end
```

This will look for deeply nested files to load in `db/seeds` and `db/seeds/#{Rails.env}` within the `accounts` and `data` directories.

Here's what they could look like.

```ruby
# db/seeds/accounts/kaspers_donuts.rb
donuts = accounts.create :kaspers_donuts, name: "Kasper's Donuts"

kasper   = users.create :kasper,   name: "Kasper",   accounts: [donuts]
coworker = users.create :coworker, name: "Coworker", accounts: [donuts]

menu = menus.create account: donuts
plain_donut     = menu_items.create menu: menu, name: "Plain",     price_cents: 10_00
sprinkled_donut = menu_items.create menu: menu, name: "Sprinkled", price_cents: 10_10

supporter = users.create name: "Super Supporter"
orders.insert_all [user_id: supporter.id, item_id: plain_donut.id] * 10

orders.insert_all \
  10.times.map { { user_id: users.create(name: "Customer #{_1}").id, item_id: menu.items.sample.id } }
```

```ruby
# db/seeds/data/plans.rb
plans.insert :basic, title: "Basic", price_cents: 10_00
```

Seed files will generally use `create` and/or `insert`. Passing a symbol to name the record is useful when reusing the data in tests.

Now you can run `bin/rails db:seed` — plus Oaken skips executing a seed file if it knows the file hasn't been changed since the last seeding. Speedy!

### Interlude: Directory Naming Conventions

Oaken has some chosen directory conventions to help strengthen your understanding of your object graph:

- Have a directory for your top-level model, like `Account`, `Team`, `Organization`, that's why we have `db/seeds/accounts` above.
- `db/seeds/data` for any data tables, like the plans a SaaS app has.
- `db/seeds/tests/cases` for any specific cases that are only used in some tests, like `pagination.rb`.

### Reusing data in tests

With the setup above, Oaken can reuse the same data in tests like this:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  include Oaken::TestSetup
end
```

Now tests have access to `accounts.kaspers_donuts` and `users.kasper` etc. that were setup in the data scripts.

You can also load a specific seed, like this:

```ruby
class PaginationTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  seed "cases/pagination"
end
```

### Resetting cache

Oaken is still early days, so you may need to reset the cache that skips seed files. Pass `OAKEN_RESET` to clear it:

```sh
OAKEN_RESET=1 bin/rails db:seed
OAKEN_RESET=1 bin/rails test
```

### Fixtures Converter

You can convert your Rails fixtures to Oaken's seeds by running:

    $ bin/rails generate oaken:convert:fixtures

This will convert anything in test/fixtures to db/seeds. E.g. `test/fixtures/users.yml` becomes `db/seeds/users.rb`.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add oaken

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install oaken

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `cd test/dummy` and `bin/rails test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
