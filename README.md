# Oaken

The gem we're building in the Open Source Retreat https://kaspthrb.gumroad.com/l/open-source-retreat-summer-2023

## Installation

TODO: Replace with private package install instructions.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add oaken

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install oaken

## Features

### Fixture to Seed Converter

You can now use Oaken to easily convert your Rails fixtures to seedable models. To utilize this feature, run the following command:

    $ rails generate oaken:fixture_converter

This will convert `users.yml` to `users.rb`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
